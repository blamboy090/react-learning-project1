# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

- React is a declarative language, relying on react to determine how to take code and write it to DOM
- JSX, HTML JS hybrid
    - cannot use class need className
    - creates JS objects
    - can only return single parent element, wrap multiple elements in <div></div>

    1. To be able to use JSX (JSX sytax is defined in react) [O]
    2. an Object (Javascript object) [O]
    3. Missing <div> (need to be nested under a single parent element) [O]
    4. Explicit instructions vs Implied instructions [X] (can tell computer what to do and expect it to handle the details vs need to tell how to do each step)
    5. Can consist of many components [O] We have small pieces that we can put together to make something larger/ greater than the individual pieces

Pop Quiz!
    1. Modular block of code (function that returns react elements) [X]
    2. Not Pascal case [O]
    3. No parent div(componenet call was incorrect used () no <>) [X]
